(1) The whatsapp feature is fantastic - super easy to set reminders on the move, on the laptop via whatsapp web, & very effective to make sure I don't miss anything. (2) the widgets aren't great. I have a widget on my phone home screen/ Tab & the date doesn't automatically change so sometimes I'm looking at yesterday's tasks/calendar & I have to manually open the app - correct it... I can't seem to tick off the tasks from the widget. I have to open the app. Irritating!","390 people found this review helpful","Any.do To-do list & Calendar","June 22, 2021","Thank you for your feedback!

For example, you can't control the font size on the widget. In order for it to show you both tasks and calendar entries for your day, you'll need to devote nearly your whole screen to see it.
