Integration with Google Calendar is a bonus, and really useful. An option to add notes to tasks and sub-tasks would be helpful. While deleting completed tasks keeps the app clutter free, sometimes I felt the need for looking somewhere to see what all has been completed over a period of time.","36 people found this review helpful"

Can't have repeating Tasks beyond the month. They are set to repeat indefinitely and there's no ""till date"" parameter. And when trying to fix it things just go haywire. Deleting and creating similar ones one adds to the problem. Specially aince it does not allow to add tasks in the past. It is really helpful to keep track of things. Please add this functionality Devs, after repairing the core functionality.","6 people found this review helpful"

And also that it was possible to change which list a task is under AFTER setting it as recurring. Doesn't seem to be possible. Also wish it would allow to re-arrange the order of the list headings with a long press and drag. Additionally! Would also also be nice if it were possible to re-arrange the order of tasks within the day they're set for while the sorting option is set to 'date.' Works mostly well with some annoying issues.","49 people found this review helpful"

The fact that I can't move a repeating task to a different list is just inexcusable. I mean, why? I really hope Google puts more time and effort into Tasks. I'm a fan of using the native apps with an OS. I'd also like to be able to drag and drop tasks in Calendar. Doesn't work for all day tasks for some reason. I'm holding out hope!

Recurring tasks only appear once. Once you complete it the 1st time, it doesn't reappear on your list until the DAY IT'S DUE. You can't plan ahead. You have to open GCalendar in order to plan ahead for recurrences. If I have to open GCalendar anyways, I might as well just make recurring reminders and not even bother with tasks. Tasks is supposed to be an easy to view ""to-do"" list, but completely fails with recurring tasks.","327 people found this review helpful"

A task which repeats should be shown once and float day by day until it's checked off and then another task is created. Either per original schedule or from the day it was checked off. But populating years worth of monthly repeats is useless. And bimonthly tasks are showing up every month. So that's another bug.But the sync between platforms is great so I'm hoping this gets fixed.
