I gave 4 out of 5 only because of the reduced user experience. The new one - although it supports black theme - is not as eye-picky as the previous version. The font size on the Widget is not adjustable. The icons and the texts are difficult to read and comprehend. I was relying on the icons before. Now the icons are small. For the repeating tasks, instead of the date of the task, it shows the creation date (from the past), which is meaningless.","17 people found this review helpful","","","",""

However each one had its own issue. Some were too tedious and some were just not enough. This one is the latest one i tried and i upgraded just after 15 minutes of use (its that good). Though 4(🌟) is because of only 1 reason - its not cross platform. But the maker is sincere and we know he is trying to come up with web version at least. Best of luck.","8 people found this review helpful","Memorigi","August 17, 2020","Thank you Tapan for your review. Memorigi Web is going to be released very soon.

Beautiful UI and equally good task reminder and segregation. The developer has gone into the minute details and has customised it to suit the needs of all. It has various list to segregate tasks, you can assign sub tasks to task and add notes. In nagging mode it keeps reminding you of your tasks throughout the day. It's an amazing app. You can stick with it.","11 people found this review helpful","Memorigi","May 11, 2020","Hello Rajeev! Thank you for your AWESOME review.

At first when I opened the app it was just a blank screen with a '+' button, took me a while to figure out that swiping down from top shows rest of the features 😑 Now, if I want to see my schedule for the next day I need to swipe down, click on schedule button & go to date. When you have to do it over and over again it gets too much annoying 😒 Premium price is too much as well, Tick Tick has far more features and its premium costs like half 🤷‍♂️","6 people found this review helpful","Memorigi","April 19, 2021","Thank you for your review.

They could have focused on UX design as well, but nah. When you open the app you only see a blank screen with a + button, if you want to see your schedule then you have to swipe up, go to upcoming/inbox to see what all you have to do.

Even the free version is so useful when used right, no ads, clean platform and UI, clean widget, great notification and reminder functions. All round a great app. Wish they would add a start-end time for events and allow recurring events to be free. Also, when you change colours on a list the existing elements don't change colour.

(It's amazing how clunky an average TODO can get! I tried all major competing apps, they felt like from another decade). Cons: updates fairly often break backwards compatibility in various ways. I lost all data once, another time I thought I did, because I suddenly got welcomed to a clean slate... refetching my tasks from the cloud took a couple of minutes, but the app in no way indicated it was actually pulling anything in. I've also encountered some annoying bugs that would come and go. I generally recommend it, I only deduct 1 star because QA feels like a hit-and-miss at times.","12 people found this review helpful","Memorigi","April 19, 2021","Thank you for your review.

Most prominently, I love the app's layout and design. That's what attracted me at first and that's what keeps me using it. The spatial layout of task categories, combined with a plethora of colors/icons allows a layer of customization that many to-do apps lack. Sure, it's aesthetic, but the design is what always makes it a pleasure to open and easy to work with. That's not to say Memorigi lacks functionality; I seldom find myself constrained in what I need to do and plan out. I can track my progress, create any variety of recurring tasks, and embed notes and sub-tasks with ease. The app is always evolving. The developer is constantly researching and working to improve the app, whether aesthetically or functionally, and is regularly taking feedback and suggestions from the community. It's nice knowing that Memorigi isn't going to stagnate any time soon. Give it a try!","30 people found this review helpful","Memorigi","February 26, 2020","Hi Mettrovski.
