Small feedback to PMs: as a user, if I have multiple lists in left hamburger menu, I'd like to prioritise ones with more unfinished tasks. You can make that easy by showing unfinished/finished numbers instead of total tasks against every list. Once all the tasks are done, you can show a green/blue tick instead of numbers and give me the option to archive the list","80 people found this review helpful",""

My issue is dismissing the text input on a pixel 6 pro. I could not find a way of doing that. It always leave something on screen (I cannot see just the list). I need to leave the list or reopen the text input and swipe from the edges to be able to see just the list. Please fix that. Also an option to clear completed items.","13 people found this review helpful",""

Over the years I've fallen away from that with more use of the digital calendar - which just isn't the same. This app is PERFECT for a list making person like me. I love the way it's formatted, that you can make sub-lists, and that your flagged outlook emails are noted! There's a certain satisfaction in checking things off your list. Great app!! 👍👍","20 people found this review helpful",""

Disappointed when I checked a specific item as completed & it kept coming back on my list as an open task. After searching I found it was previously marked to be reminded ""Daily."" Suggesting some type of message to confirm completion so the user would not waste time trying to figure out what's what.","2 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

On top of that, the actual app is amazing. Simplistic, but amazing. It has honestly helped me organize and get on top of my life, as I have pretty bad memory issues, so remembering to do things can be tough. With the app, I just write stuff down as they come to me, and if I ever get bored I check the app and get stuff done","5 people found this review helpful",""

I love the ability to organize tasks into folders and set recurring reminders. Lately, reminders have been hit or miss, often not going off. I hope this is fixed soon. I also just had a big scare where many of my recurring tasks disappeared, but they returned after I updated. I would still recommend this app... but don't rely on it too heavily.","106 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

However, I decided to give it another try, and I'm glad I did! I like it MUCH BETTER NOW! The dark theme, unlimited open source categories, and ease of use brought me back. I would, however, like to see more solid colors added to the themes, and the capability to add your own photos to use as themes. Otherwise, it's perfect!","63 people found this review helpful",""

But something that I miss is an option to 'undo' an action. Specifically in the widget. I sometimes accidentally mark a task as completed and want to undo that.

Being able to open files without searching for them on a tree and many different entities gathered together for easy access and then being to able to regroup.

I love the apps ability to make several lists, and the ease of adding items to ""My Day"" list. I also like being able to add due dates and reminders. Where it's lacking though, is the ability to schedule the task within the list. I wish there was a way to schedule or time block tasks on my day list so I know what I should be doing and when, and to help visualize realistic expectations for what I can accomplish in my day.","19 people found this review helpful",""

It generally work but breaks completely if you open the app in any way, it doesn't display new tasks added (even if refresh is pressed) and doesn't allow you to complete them. I have to remove it and add it again. It also bothers me that if a new task is added via the app, it won't automatically show up on the widget unless it is refreshed, which can't be done without Wi-Fi.","39 people found this review helpful",""

Is there any way to get my backgrounds restored without manually changing all of them? I had a lot of lists. Great app, helps me keep organized. One suggestion; I think that events with a due date set should be able to be automatically be added to the my day list on the day they are due if they are not on that list already. This should be an option that users can change in settings.","33 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

What I'd like to see though is reminders also repeat when a task repeats. Repeating tasks can't be set for a particular weekday for monthly, but yes for weekly...odd. Like I want a repeating task for Sat. once a month...can't do that. A calendar view would be great. When the app updates, my tasks in the status bar disappear but don't return after (minor thing).","31 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Loved this app. Now it barely functions. I have so many tasks & lists; so many reminders, recurring or single. 90% of them don't remind me anymore. At all. Some will just fall off after being snoozed, if I'm lucky, & others I won't get notifications for at all. I've done all the settings for not getting reminders, pin the app (though it somehow still closes), talked to support, for nothing. I installed their suggested app, nothing.
