I usually hate microtransactions but if it helps support a single (?) dev then I have no issues doing a one-time payment for the Pro+ version. The statistics and tags feature defintely helps keep my ADHD in check but I also hope in the near future that we get to join study groups. In the meantime, I'll be here appreciating the cute animations and overall aesthetic of this app.","1 person found this review helpful",""

But I think there should be an option for subtags.... Like what I studied under study tag... Or what I did under work tag... This would help to track the time I give for some specific activities (like studying biology or watering plants).","15 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I just have one suggestion: the icons on the home page could be changed a bit to make stuff clearer. For example the button that looks like a home button takes you to the store. Also, betting something against friends would make for a niche minigame thing and urge people to be more productive. I think you should add that, if you can, if not that's fine too. Continue doing what you're doing! It's great!","19 people found this review helpful",""

However I do notice some lack of attention to detail, like the notifications with spelling errors, and general clutterness of the app menus. Some common features are locked behind a paywall, but I wouldn't mind seeing ads in the app if it means having these unlocked.","19 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Though I will say that the game concept is very cute and is attractive enough to get my attention.","28 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Not worth it. I've been using a timer with a rabbit instead, it's less advertisement heavy and I've been loving it. Update: it was four stars months ago, when I tried it for a day, before the pop-up ads after every click. I reinstalled it recently and gave it a longer try. Since you apparently want an explanation for not liking your stopwatch app. My criticism is valid and still stands.","20 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

But 1 problem is how you need pro to do the smallest things! And 2, sometimes I can't hear the sound effects when I tap buttons but I really like the sounds so maybe fix that. Overall I really like it already recommended this to my friends and family.

I need a timer for 40 minutes but it only gives me the option of 30 and 45. I also want to report a bug that when my setting to stop the session after pomodoro cycle ends, after I collect my donuts the timer starts again and counts up as stopwatch. So I had to press stop button twice. Also, some buttons are not working like contact and bug report buttons and the ""+"" sign for coins.","17 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Timer can be 1 hour in and when i reopen the app the whole 1 hour is just gone and its at the 0:00:00 mark again. Very annoying. Also, user interface can be better, competition with friends can be more fun (see when theyre studying etc), achievements can have a separate page and there can be more achievements. The dog can be made customisable, and allow us to interact w it.The gems need a greater functionality. I see so much potential in the app, little has been done!","5 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Knowing I have my focus dog running in the background helps me to continue doing work related tasks. If I want to switch to other activities, I have to turn it off, which I do sometimes, but then I lose out on special donuts so I'm motivated to stay on task. That just works for my brain for some reason I don't pretend to understand. Thanks for the diploma, doggo!","1 person found this review helpful",""

Game elements like unlockable donuts, quests, and upgrades turn this focus timer into a fun and addicting game. Now I have an incentive to get off my phone and get things done. The free version is great, but I was happy to spend a few bucks on Pro+ if it meant supporting the developer. This app has been amazing for me as someone with ADHD and I recommend it to anyone who wants a little extra motivation to get off the phone from a funny little donut-crazed dog.","26 people found this review helpful",""

So pretty 🥰 Nevertheless, I didn't rated 5 stars because I think the Pomodoro can be better: it doesn't work in cycle mode (like other Pomodoro apps do work-rest-workx4 and then long break) rather you put the time (25 min) and then the timer stops and you have to set it again. I think with a real Pomodoro set up the app will be perfect.","9 people found this review helpful",""
