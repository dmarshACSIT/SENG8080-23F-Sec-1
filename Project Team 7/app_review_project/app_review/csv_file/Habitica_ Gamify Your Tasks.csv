Although I found it a little confusing to use, not a big deal though, I just had to see two YouTube videos and read a beginner's guide (sarcasm intended). My complaint with it is that it works only online — if I were to make a task while being offline and I connect to internet later, all of those tasks get deleted. This is not a fun thing at all!","85 people found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","February 16, 2022","Thanks for your review and feedback. We plan to add offline mode in the future.

It is the ultimate game. But it has a lot of bugs. I can't delete tasks, I can't edit tasks that were premade by the app. 2-3 basic features are missing. I'll change the rating to 5 stars once it is fixed. No, I'll not contact your team or email them the problem. It is basic and you should just fix the goddamn app. Edit : I have updated it from 2 to 4 stars cause major bugs have been fixed. Will make it 5 if the experience continues.","18 people found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","October 21, 2020","Hey there, sorry to hear about these issues.

This is a brilliant concept! however the app seems a bit buggy. I was in beta programme and then I was unable to send invites or buy certain items. I thought it's because of beta being unstable so I opted out of beta and reinstalled the app, still didn't fix the issue. I'm the party leader and the group isnset so that only I can start quests, still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and I don't face this on browser.","32 people found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","May 5, 2020","Hi Navinya, you can send bug reports directly to the developers with Menu-About-Report a Bug, and that will send the team some information about your device to help them find the problem.

It has made me interested again in being productive. It's almost like adopting a lifestyle! However, the app is currently having a problem with task reminders. It doesn't work most of the time and when it does, the alert is usually delayed by approx. 10 minutes. Also, it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline. Other than that, the app is perfect!

It'd be great to have the ability to organise habits by tags, groups, or colours, and also to set up notification reminders to check if you've fulfilled your habit. It also significantly looses some of its usefulness and fun by encouraging time wasting (unnecessary clicks, clunky menus) and grinding (the diamonds can't be won in any way, and have to be bought, as far as I could tell).

I couldn't figure out how to make a group for my family and close friends. It seems like the Party feature isn't customizable and the Guild feature requires currency which I'm not that far into yet. Also, I find it annoying that I can't organize my tasks by dragging it around the way I see fit. The filter is the only option which I have to redo that everytime which gets a little annoying.

It is easily the best Habit app I've ever used. But there are 2 big issues I have with it which is stopping me from doing so. 1st is the lack of an offline mode, making it difficult for me to use and keep up to date with my goals and tasks, this NEEDS to be addressed. 2nd is a nitpick, but the group feature which would be great for families is locked behind a monthly paywall. I would gladly pay if it was a one time fee.","","","","",""

One thing though - the ""monthly, day of week"" Daily function spans multiple surrounding days rather than only Saturday, for example. So that might be a hard hit for users hoping to use that. I would also love being able to preemptively pause a daily for when I'm on vacation, out of the normal rhythm, etc!

Only thing I'd say is if you could have an undo button. I press plus by accident and it levels me up. I like to earn the achievement, no mods round here. Thank you","1 person found this review helpful","","","",""

My tasks will change names when I check them off, and even if I receive a notification that I've found and egg ect, it won't show in inventory","","","","","Show review history"

Turns your to-do list into an RPG. You earn items, pets, and customization options. It's fun to join friends in parties and attack bosses together, then dress yourself like a fish. Uses more negative reinforcement, which i don't care for, but there are ways to mitigate the effect because everything is so customizable. Endgame is frustrating because upward growth becomes stymied after a while, but character can be reset, and updates are constant.","29 people found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","September 6, 2022","Thanks so much for your review and rating.

Rose Huttner","October 11, 2022","Fun and motivating. suggestions for future updates: the to do list should be more customizable. You should be able to organize tasks by days without entering a due date & you Should be able to filter completed tasks by date (I love seeing everything crossed off at the end of the day). 2, I wish there was a way to enter tasks for total # of times in a week vs specific days. Ie I want to do yoga 3x/wk but not necessarily every other day.","","HabitRPG, Inc.","October 14, 2022","Thanks so much for your review and feedback!

The only thing letting it down for us is we would like an app where we can share tasks out as a household. To get this functionality the app needs a $9 subscription a month with an additional $3 per additional member in the group. That's more expensive than most full featured triple-A MMO's! Please lower the pricing of the group / task sharing to be more appropriate and we will subscribe without hesitation.","","HabitRPG, Inc.","November 14, 2022","Hi there, thanks for your review. Habitica itself is free to use. It seems you are referencing our Group Plans which do have a monthly fee. Group Plans and subscriptions allow us to maintain Habitica without having to sell user data (the main income source for most apps). Thanks for checking us out!",""

That is kinda lame to reward people who pay rather than encouraging them to keep up life improvement. It also is very slow leveling up unless you count mundane tasks like ""bush teeth, wipe a$$, sleep 8hrs"" and other basic living necessities.... which I guess for nerds is a problem?? o_O Also the sprites could look better. At least upgrade to SNES graphics.","2 people found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","November 2, 2022","Thanks for your review! All items that can be obtained with gems are cosmetic, and quests can be shared with partymates. There are also ways to earn gems: https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Gems#Obtaining_Gems_for_Free Our artwork is done by volunteers from our community and is intended to evoke a retro style.

This would work for someone who wants to check off daily chores that need done every day, or daily habits you're trying to form. I was hoping to use this as a planner, & it does not work for that. The ""to-do"" list tab is lacking a way to plan your week & create tasks for a different day. It will however work for ongoing tasks with a deadline, perfect for students. Not for someone like me who doesn't have a set routine.","","HabitRPG, Inc.","November 2, 2022","Hi, Beth! Thanks so much for your detailed review.

I thought it was just going to be a habit tracker but Guilds, to dos, due dates, challenges, rewards, widgets for phone, no cap this app goes above and beyond. Best habit tracker without a doubt. Ps, the designs of the gear looks sick. I'm really satisfied with this all.","","HabitRPG, Inc.","November 2, 2022","Hi, Abdoulaye! Thanks so much for your review.

I would recommend. There are zero ads, zero pay walls, if anything it sounds a bit daft the devs are making much money on this, might be a passion project. Only downside I could point out is the app doesnt work if you're not connected to the internet I hope they can do something about that other than that its a great app 5 stars Edit: Can you consider adding harder difficulties for tasks","1 person found this review helpful","HabitRPG, Inc.","November 7, 2022","Hi, Shane!
