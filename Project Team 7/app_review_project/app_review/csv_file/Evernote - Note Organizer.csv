The font can not be fixed by your choice. Also you can type in full screen as the side bar can not be removed. The full screen isn't really a full scream and you can by mistakenly press the side too. Since I am lefty.. it's kind of annoying. The drawing part makes you draw on a separate image and then gets inserted in the notes. Can't draw separately on your typed notes.","","","",""

It always creates duplicate conflict notes and it takes mmforever to figure out which one has the newest information on it. When I create check lists on my computer and check something off from my phone, all of the check boxes turn to bullet points. I always have to change them back because I need to see which things are checked off without deleting them completely. Changing apps today!","7 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 4, 2022","Hi Aaron, we’re very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to investigate these issues further.

There are numerous bugs, from having to select ""find in note"" twice to make the search appear to losing text after the cursor when holding down backspace to erroring out while editing notes and creating 5 copies - it's no longer worth the risk of losing information I care about and need.","2 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 18, 2022","Hi Jeff - we’re very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to investigate these issues further.

I've been using it since 2016 and at that time the app worked much stable and convenient. I think if nobody would touch it during the last 4 years it would be even better, every change made is just terrible. Now it just can't manage even with main functions! When I try syncing notes: 1) nothing happens, green stickers are still on the notes 2) I've always gotten conflicts.","4 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 18, 2022","Hi Andrey - we’re very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to investigate these issues further.

After several days I finally got an updated sync and then it stopped again. It has now been more than a day with no updates to my mobile platform. Before you go there, yes, modern Samsung phone, up to date and the app is BRAND NEW because I keep uninstalling and reinstalling, but, still no regular sync and even selecting the manual sync in the settings drop down accomplishes NOTHING. What is the point - other apps work!","1 person found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 18, 2022","We’re very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to investigate this issue further.

Happy to pay for Premium. Its now unusable, especially on android. Duplication, losing notes, not saving, slow or won't open notes, circle of death, search not working. Now I'm bricking it that I will lose all the essential info I have stored for 12 years. Please please revert back to working version. Now googling how to export all my notes as have completely lost confidence in tool. Will cancel subscription when my data is safely stored elsewhere. Shame.","18 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 18, 2022","We’re very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to investigate these issues further.

It's useful too that your notes are stored in the cloud, so you can access them from any device. However, there's an annoying problem: my notes keep duplicating for no reason. It's getting frustrating to have to open and delete several copies of the same note. I don't know why this is happening, I've never intentionally duplicated a note.","21 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","November 1, 2022","Hi Lewis - we’re very sorry to hear about your experience.

If you want to scale up your organization, you need more than just a to do list app. Evernote is one way to go. I recently switched to a new phone and Evernote app from v8 to v10. It was a jarring change at first, but the new version helps save me time through the configurable home screen: I can show a list of notes with reminders due today right there. I seem to be able to more quickly and easily search to find what I need now too.","23 people found this review helpful","Evernote Corporation","October 4, 2022","Hi Ryan - we're sorry to hear about your experience.
