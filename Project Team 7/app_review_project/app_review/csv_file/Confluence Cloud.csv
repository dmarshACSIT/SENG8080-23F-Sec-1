I'm a fan of confluence on the Web but this app is a terrible implementation of a great product. It better not to offer an app at all than ruin a great product. For instance, why do I need to 'tap to load' a list of child pages on a parent placeholder page. In what world would I not want to automatically see the list of child pages? OK, when I do tap to load, then it may or may not load said children.","8 people found this review helpful","Show review history","","",""

Drafts do not sync which means that you have to publish anytime you make changes if you want to save them. The app eats up a lot of screen space that the website does not. At least on the website especially if you use desktop mode, you can change the sizing to meet your needs.","1 person found this review helpful","","","",""
