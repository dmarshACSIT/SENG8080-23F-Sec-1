However, tasks set to repeat daily don't show up automatically. I have to manually add each recurring task to my daily list. Premium version is good so far but could do with a few more helpful additions like viewing my timer sessions broken down in the daily schedule page, easily shift tasks/events around in the calendar, and improving the notification bar and widget features. Still, one of the best productivity apps I've used.","7 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","September 27, 2022","Hello Afshan,

I have extreme ADHD, lack of attention and motivation, and when i see the ""+5"" button to add some time to a break, i just click it. Can there be a toggle to switch it on and off in the settings? Other than that, the best productivity app i have ever used. Only issue i had since yesterday was when another app's reminder popped up(Fullscreen Task reminder), Engross froze and my device became unresponsive. Frustrating.","8 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","October 18, 2022","Hello Utkarsh,

Fortunately this app's providing me a track of effective study hours I manage to get in a day which makes me reflect on and review my own output.

Integration should be also be included like 2 way sync with google calendar and notion so that note taking also becomes easy. The app is really amazing.","27 people found this review helpful","","",""

As the app aint that tacky, it was quite easy for me to navigate through. The planner's synced in with your calendar too. That helps a lot. I'd recommend it for someone who wants to focus and do their thing.","","","",""

App white list. It has both timer and stopwatch. Can set study, revision and break times and multiple sessions ( though I have noticed it does not take the revision time under total study time, please do consider and add the revision time to total study time.Had to choose 5min/10min, would be better if we could choose in btwn minutes )The to-do with the completion bar is perfect. Happy with it.","","Engross Apps","October 29, 2020","Hello Nageli Sreevani,

I'm lovin it. I love this app and its simplicity. It helps me focus. I was looking forward for a feature, where I could schedule tasks. There's a tab for tasks in schedule area, I don't understand the reason of it being there, when we cannot block a certain time for certain task. Please see, if such a feature could be incorporated. Thanks a lot!","12 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","July 26, 2019","Hi Kritesh,
Thank you for your feedback. I totally understand your point, in fact we were planning to have this feature, but could not implement it due to certain constraints on repeating tasks. But, we will surely try to incorporate it and efficiently. If you face any kind of issues, please feel free to write to us at support@engrossapp.com."

My requirements are simple. Set long sessions with multiple pomos with long breaks. This app has it all, none of the core features are behind a paywall. So I could try it and then pay the developers as a token of appreciation for their work. Plus get some cool features too. The app is feature rich. It is great especially for students. Engross keeps you engrossed in work, not the app itself. That made me fall in love with it.","8 people found this review helpful","","",""

The apps like Clockify & Toggl don't stand a chance with engross in terms of functionality but they have a web version whichakes them easier to use anytime & anywhere without any effort. That's the reason I'm switching back. It would be a great advantage for it if it creates a web version, just a simple site for the go","","Engross Apps","May 24, 2021","Hi Nilesh,
Thank you for appreciating and really sorry for the inconvenience. We are just working on the sync feature, we'll be having it up soon and we do have plans for a web version in the future. Thank you for all the feedback, we'll work our best to make Engross as useful as it can be. :)"

I have paid subscription and here are my 2 suggestion to be made. 1. long break is not possible after completing the session. For example if I have 4 sessions planned, planed long break has to happen before that. Which is not correct. 2.if folder structure along with lists would be much useful, other than using labels I was big fan of TickTick app, but this app too has potential to be better and best.. All the best","4 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","July 21, 2020","Hi Sudhindra,
Thanks a lot for recommending Engross! :) 1. Actually, there is a separate option to start long break at the end of all sessions, you'll find it on the right of timer. 2. We'll surely try to add folder option in the future updates. If you face any kind of issues, please feel free to write to us at support@engrossapp.com. Thank you!!"

It basically uses the pomodoro technique where you study in sessions for a long amount of time and take a shorter break. You can block distracting apps during your work.In the trial version you can only use limited features so better to buy it as it is one time buy. This app is useful not just for students but pretty much for anyone who needs constant deep focus.","3 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","March 9, 2020","Hi Manabjyoti,
Thank you for such a wonderful review and recommending Engross!
We are really happy you find Engross useful. For studying, you can also try the revision timer, that would help to retain things better. If you have any suggestions for improvement or if you face any issues, please let us know at support@engrossapp.com."

But it would be even more nice if at least the statistical development is shown for limited tasks or sessions to know how one can control and controlled themselves. However, this is a very useful app. Thankyou developers and I hope that you might consider my request as a suggestion.","2 people found this review helpful","Engross Apps","October 19, 2020","Hello Sarada,

Then I have to pause it and resume again so that it can show the proper timings again in the notification bar... That's the only minor issue with this app Edit:- i haven't received any response yet 🙄","4 people found this review helpful","","",""
