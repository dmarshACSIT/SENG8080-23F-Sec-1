This only con/bug I found was in the feature present in which the non designed icons get a dark ring even covered a thin color ,And the feature by which we can change the color is pretty unique , however I thought that one tap will change the ring to the displayed color, but it was random , so I did it , and kept doing it until I got my desired color , please fix this and make the method easy, other than that it's a 5🌟","271 people found this review helpful"

Stick with the free version. The creator is not actively updating. It's been 8 months since the last update and premium icon packs should be getting an update at least every 1-2 months. And judging by how other apps made by this creator, this is a trend. Make something then neglect it. I would look for alternatives which is a shame because these are actually really nice icons. Alternatively get outline icon by RandomVector.","562 people found this review helpful"

It has a nice Clean and Consistent style. There aren't icons for some fairly popular apps (mainly games) but I will still rate 5 stars because this is free and the expectation is lower.","1 person found this review helpful"

I mainly wanted them to try to help with battery life and prevent screen burn. Oled screens don't use any power for black areas of screen and of course darker areas of screen use less power. I use a primarily black background and combined with the reduced graphics coverage should help (even if marginally) with battery life and maybe image burn. The icons are designed really well which is a bonus","88 people found this review helpful"

The only real caveat is that it is, as noted by the dev, quite limited so far, with only about 1/4 of my apps having icons. It works for me because I really only needed it for my homescreen and can find suitable icons for the apps I have pinned there (I just leave the app drawer with native icons), but if you want an icon for every app this might not be the pack for you.","117 people found this review helpful"

Overall, I recognize the hard work that is being put into this icon pack since it's still getting updates so I can say that the app did have a positive impact on me.. Keep up the good work, we might cross roads again and it hopefully will last longer next time :)","13 people found this review helpful"

This pack worked really good and I'm using it from the last 3months and matched my theme perfectly. I'm on Poco F1 and now I'm unable to apply it. The icons are not turning into black themed but they look like default icons. This is happening since the last time update if I can recall correctly. 5stars for serving me good but I'd really appreciate if you can provide a solution on how to get back the black theme borderline icons. Thank You.","73 people found this review helpful"

If the dev reads this, I wasted my app requests coz he seems not to have entered his email address. I was taken straight from the app to Gmail to send my list but it ended up bouncing back because the address to send (which admittedly I didn't check) is just a generic 'your email here' placeholder which dev should have replaced with his. Also I was surprised that a couple of common Microsoft apps aren't supported: OneDrive & Office kept their icons. Still worth 5 stars","127 people found this review helpful"

I really want to use it though because I've seen the icon designs so please add support for Moto App Launcher. Edit: it's been half a year since I first asked for Moto App Launcher support - I even contacted and emailed the developer and have received no response.
