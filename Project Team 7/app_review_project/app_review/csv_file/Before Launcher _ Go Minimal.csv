The create your own theme option is broken. Launcher only contains one basic gesture option. While Before Launcher is minimal, it isn't functional enough to buy the pro. Also, there's no option to change the font size of the app drawer. If these options are added, maybe it'll be a little better than it is now.","⎋ Before Labs","October 27, 2022","Bharat -- let us know if you need help getting a refund (if you aren't happy, we really want you to have your money back). The next release is in beta testing and will add more gesture support. You can change the app drawer font size, a little, via Android text/font size setting. Can you email us about the theme option? feedback@beforelabs.com","",""

Have bought the Pro version as well. However, there are a load of bugs right now and it doesn't feel stable. Ex: 1. The icons for folders keep acting up, going all crazy. 2. First time I installed the app, it went into a crashing loop and refused to open. Had to install it again. 3. The themes menu is very glitchy. 4. Folders don't show up in sort by size, recents, or install date. 5. No option to sort apps in folders. 6. Renaming apps is glitchy.","⎋ Before Labs","June 12, 2020","Hi Shobit. According to Google, our app has been very stable. We haven't seen those issues you report. But we have a new release out that offers several fixes.

Also has a Do Not Disturb switch to pause all notifications at once. Enough color themes to get you through. Some form of black and white is all you need though. Install. Get your focus back.

I come from OnePlus launcher, and I miss certain features and these features will most probably keep the idea as it is. Certain gestures like double tap to turn off screen, swipe down to notifications and swipe up for search is very much needed. Also the sensitivity of the swipes seems off, if only I could change it .

Aims at being clean and minimalist and accomplishes that with ease. One request to the developers though, the app transitions are a bit rough when I press the home button. Opening an app (any app) has a really nice fade sort of transition which works smoothly, but closing an app just abruptly takes me to the home screen without any transition and that looks very odd.

Im a big fan of Nova and wanted to try something new. I liked this launcher's minimalism and it looks great on amoled. I would personally like to see editable app names on main screen and a right or center alignment would be great as well. The notification filter is very underrated. I loved that feature. White icons to go with the app name would great too. Overall very happy with it.","⎋ Before Labs","August 8, 2019","Venu - thanks for the support. Glad to hear the minimal design and reduced distractions are working for you. We are just a few months away from releasing support for editable app names, icon packs and other features (see our Play Store listing). Email us with other thoughts at:  feedback@beforelabs.com","","1 person found this review helpful"

Even notifications are filtered by it based on apps. No hanging issue. Buy pro version for sure to support the team. Edited - launcher doesn't support app switching. Apps close down and tend to open again completely from start screen when we try to switch between apps. Please bring it ASAP. It's a big missing.","⎋ Before Labs","September 21, 2021","Jaideep -- sorry for the trouble on this. This is a new one to us and are hoping we can have a back/forth in email ( feedback@beforelabs.com ). Looking forward to helping you out with this.","Show review history","10 people found this review helpful"

Best minimalist launcher to opt for. At first, the pro version didn't seem to offer much over and above the free version but once I got it, it was totally worth it. Buy it! The features, the ease, the privacy..... Love it!","","","","Show review history","7 people found this review helpful"

Would be nice to have some gesture support. When we're in app drawer, a swipe down can trigger search function. When on homescreen, swipe up gesture can assistant / other app or action. Double tapping the black space can trigger ""sleep"" or other app etc. Swipe down gesture can be used to get another trigger. Also, it would be nicer to have the app switch to a dark theme based on time of the day / custom schedule / system dark mode.","","","","Show review history",""
