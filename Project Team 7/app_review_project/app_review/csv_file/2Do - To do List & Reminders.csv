I can't even figure out how to add items to a list for the grocery store. Way way too much. These guys have forgotten a core principle of design. Beauty is simply and function. And above all it has to work and be easy to use. I'll be deleting this monstrosity and sideloading the legacy version.,4 people found this review helpful,

Nice U.I. too and reasonably priced without subscription! It would be nice the lists in "" today "" mode to be foldable and to have the ability to make simple plain notes ( not notes in tasks that you already can ).

Definitely check out the tutorial vids. There aren't many button descriptions which is great once you know how it works but hides lots of features if you don't take the time to go through the tutorials. The only serious downside that could convince me to switch to another app is the lack of an pc based interface. Everything needs to be done in the app which can be cumbersome and inefficient at times.",14 people found this review helpful,

I make different categories - work, home, school - then pop in tasks or lists. Easy to add things on the go. Love the reminder and due date features. The reminders pop up on my notifications. So, you can set them to come up first thing or at the time you need to do them. So it can work as a task list or even an appointment reminder.. Love that it lives on my phone - no connection needed. Great app!",15 people found this review helpful,

Subtasks and checklists are fantastic for tracking my habits and bigger projects.

Loads of unintuitive little pictogram buttons with no explanation what they do Some you click on and nothing seems to happen (e.g. the little sun?). Some you click on and baffling things happen ( what does ""smart list created"" mean? No apparent state change and no explanation provided beyond those words).

Until now! 2Do is the holy grail of all task managers, whether you just want a simple checklist or fully fledged projects. 2Do is so flexible and customisable that it has genuinely helped me manage my life and business. A special mention to the developers must be made, I had a few queries and all I can say is that the level of support and the speed of their response was second to none. They care passionately about 2Do and their customers user experience. The biggest deciding factor for me is that 2Do is a one-off purchase and not subscription based which again the developers have also voiced their disapproval of subscriptions. This again shows that the developers care more about the quality and integrity of the product and customer experience rather than trying to make a quick buck.
