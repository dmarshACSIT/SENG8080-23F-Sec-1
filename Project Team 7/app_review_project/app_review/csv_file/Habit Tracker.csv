Does exactly what it's supposed to do with a clean and minimalistic UI. A couple of suggestions to the Dev would be to add a threshold option while setting up a habit(like no more than x); if it's crossed then the streak would be broken. Also to add time as a unit, if my wake up time is 7am and I wake up at 7.30, it should show as failed and not aggregate the daily time in the stats. Thanks a lot for creating such an amazing app","5 people found this review helpful",""

Only, one feature that I like you to add would be for the Habits where we need to put values, if it can show a threshold line for the minimum requirement, or if the bar colour changes for the days you were not able to achieve tour goal that would be great. I hope it gets added in a future update","20 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Its Clean, Simple and Intuitive. I have a few feature suggestion. A target that increases by a set amount after a set amount of time could be helpful. Say you want to improve a habit by 1% everyday. Then the target amount should also increase by 1 percent everyday for that task. This would allow for gradual improvement over an extended time frame, which in my opinion is better than completing a static target amount.","3 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It has been a great value ad. Please can you help by adding ""Search Field to Find a habit"" on the menu. Please help with provision of updating time schedule across each habit, it would add more to the benefit because habits when developed consistently across the same time, builds a human being's character. And lastly a provision for compartmentalising set of habits. Thank you so much for this lovely gift. Take care.","56 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It also seems to incorporate the idea of habit inertia where you're allowed to miss a day or two if your overall commitment is strong. The ux is simple and intuitive and dark mode looks great. Unlike other so-called premium apps, there are no distracting bells and whistles (or ads). Overall, a simple and effective way to build your habits.

I've tried using numerous apps which have a lotof features I wanted but eventually they became too tedious to do everyday. I think if keeping track of our habits itself becomes a difficult habit to maintain, then it's doomed to fail. This app lets me not only mark habits as done/not done, but also makes the distinction between a lapse (failure) and a skip (not a failure). And it still remains easy to use!","13 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It sadly does not mention the month and year. So basically something like a week/month view like most calendar app, but even in a simple view. Also, have you considered allowing 0 of 7 days as a valid tracking option. It'll help to track habits you're trying to break.

Suggestion: Could you please make it look aesthetically better? I mean, I like this look, but it's really compact and dense and the crosses that you hold to transform them into ticks don't feel very satisfying due to their small size. You know, that little ""satisfaction of the click"" makes all the difference in the world. It's a mental trigger to make you want more of that feeling. Also, please introduce more colours.

This app needs a little sophistication. There are times when out of compulsions we are not able to stick to our goal of performing something daily. It is unhappy to see streak being lost without our mistake. There can be an option for including on a certain day a box wherein we could write why we couldnt do something that day. That can also help in future to go back and see what happened that led to non performance. That way 1 can avoid same mistake.","4 people found this review helpful",""
