It offers less features than the website overall, and unlike other applications, it forcibly captures ALL github links without offering to go to Chrome first. Actually opening the website on Chrome is a challenge now. BUT I can't uninstall it if I want to keep the two factor token it provides. I hate it.","22 people found this review helpful",""
