It randomly stops ringing. All the device volumes are up and there is no do not disturb running. In fact I have put this app as an exception for do not disturb mode, but still there is no alarm. If this crucial issue is fixed, this app is perfect.","11 people found this review helpful","zeitic.co","August 10, 2022","Thank you for your review!

I am facing this problem where the sound doesn't come even though my phone volumes are up. Hope it gets fixed soon. Also , I have a few suggestions : 1- Adding custom color to the bars would be great. 2- A todo list that you can choose for tags. 3- Maybe an optional alarm would also be great because sometimes we lose track of time and the break automatically goes on to the next focus session. Thanks!","52 people found this review helpful","","","","Show review history"

But the app has many many bugs. 1. If I start the timer at a time, pause it in middle and resume it, and end it some other time, it showing that I completed the task continuously without break, from the starting time. 2. If I minimise and come back, the timer restarts from the beginning.","20 people found this review helpful","zeitic.co","October 27, 2020","Thank you for your feedback and highlighting these issues to us.

The only issue I have is that everything is in minutes rather than in hours which makes quite difficult to analyse if I am studying. Hope they think about this Edit: now again there's issue.

It will only alert after the timer end which is the entire set of focus and rest. It won't alert the transition between focus to rest, nor will it alert while on loop. I hope this can be fixed. And if I may add, I also would appreciate the ability to adjust the the timer up to the second.

However, it urgently needs an option to backup with the cloud; I lost all my progress from months ago due to my cellphone broking and there's no way to recover the data. I didn't want to before, but I guess it's time to move to another app that secures my data better, at least until there's something actually efficient and safe in Focusmeter.

The timer design is lovely to look at, minimal, great dark mode and shows the countdown with both a digital clock and a visual. I like the prompt to start each focus/rest timer - helps nudge the brain toward intentional productivity. It's straightforward and powerful to customise the notifications (sound and vibrate options; can play alerts as an alarm or media or notification; and alerts available for midway through timer, 1 min before completion and at completion).
