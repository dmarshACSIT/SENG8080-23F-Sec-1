Using it for my trip right now. All my data, documents, bookings, itineraries, photos that I have on my laptop are automatically synced as I go on booking, researching and adding on my laptop, I have them all on my phone. Working very well across all my devices. I think it's better than Samsung Note and Evernote.","139 people found this review helpful","","","",""

But it does sync. I got to know it when I added a new acc. But some drawbacks still exist- e.g., we still cant insert tables on the app. Some years back, it was good, but now it's not that good. Pages don't even sync properly. Even what you write in the note may disappear suddenly. For example, the whole article may disappear, or words from sentences may disappear randomly. It doesn't save well.","194 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Microsoft Corporation","April 28, 2022","We're sorry you're facing issues.

You can type, edit, draw, sketch, and what not. It also syncs into multiple devices instantaneously, and you never have to worry about not having saved you last work (which I find is the best).

I like exporting to PDFs, using an infinite page makes this difficult. The way ""pages"" are set up right now treats them like completely separate documents for each new page, which is weird.","9 people found this review helpful","","","",""

Quality of drawings while taking notes are horrible because it would be pixelated especially when zooming in. The app gets laggy a bunch of times while using. The stylus system is horrible. You can't select a drawing without the tool being buggy. The selector and eraser goes everywhere across the screen.

I use the voice dictation quite a bit and it's mostly great. I'd give it five stars if they could refine the on-the-go editing of the dictation. It's a bit clunky and buggy, requiring lots of stopping to fix punctuation that jumps around, or sometimes it duplicates sentences. A few other issues like that, small things that slow down workflow.

It should have all the features on Android as it does on PC. I pay for a subscription and seriously considering other alternatives.","37 people found this review helpful","","Microsoft Corporation","October 4, 2022","Thanks for sharing your feedback!

I have had a few consistent issues, including light/dark mode, feature support, and pen tracking issues with the lasso select tool. When the app is in light mode, some of the text is white, and while in dark mode, the highlighters don't work, except in Windows, where there's also more features. The lasso tool also acts like the pen is all over the screen even if it's not.","6 people found this review helpful","","","",""

My only reason for giving a 4 instead of 5 star rating is because the new update introduced this feature where my notes are arranged in grids and completely removed the ability to rearrange my notes as a list. I really liked arranging my notes as a list as opposed to the grid format.","","","","",""
