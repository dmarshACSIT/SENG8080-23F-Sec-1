As another user reported, the toolbar (which used to be on top), like the full desktop version, is now at the bottom, and very difficult to use. Totally counter intutive. It's become like the mobile version, which is difficult to use. It fails to take advantage of the larger size of android tablets. Microsoft. Please fix!","2,782 people found this review helpful",""

Easily edit documents and collaborate on the go. The Excel spreadsheet app lets you create, view, edit, and share your files with others quickly and easily. Sheets can easily be checked, edited and shared on the go. Excel makes it easy to review and analyze data, budgets more while you view and edit workbooks attached to email messages. Edit documents for data analysis, accounting, finance, or any other fields with confidence. When on the go, your data and office.","5,650 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

And there were sooo many years like that. They've shown marked improvement over the past 6 or 8 years which has made me an excel fan boy. Their Android app is amazing!! Simple, easy to use, yet has so many features for a mobile app. Don't think that you'll even come close to the full desktop version, but you can do more than you would think. Great job MS!!","160 people found this review helpful",""

The larger screen helps. On my phone it is okay to view, but to enter anything or manipulate the borders of cells is nearly impossible. I don't know what the solution of that would be because that is a constraint of the size of the device. In general, regarding the tablet, it would be nice to have things like cell size and word suggestion behave more like the PC/Windows version.","154 people found this review helpful",""

I use it for tracking my workouts so it's a pretty basic use. It did upload well from my original sheet and I can download it into my PC Excel to extract data, so that's good utility. Navigation is a bit difficult on a small phone touch screen. I dont know if it would be of much use with a more complicated spreadsheet but I haven'ttried that.
